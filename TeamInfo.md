## Project Summary

We aim to analyze the potential reasons behind flight interruptions by looking at the different airlines, airports, and the reasoning behind the interruptions. Our goal is to visualize routes grouped by different criteria and find the best route to get to a particular airport by examining all the different features mentioned previously. Our approach will involve using the U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics from 2015.
